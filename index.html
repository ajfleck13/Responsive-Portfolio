        <p>
            I am a physics major and a hobbyist coder of several years, and currently pursuing training for full-stack web development for a full development career.
            I started into coding after playing a few open source games and looking into the code behind them to fix and improve them when I could. 
            This led me to join their team and begin learning from the experienced inviduals in the project.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a year of fixing and improving their code, I joined the more senior part of the team myself.
            I began training new recruits who stumbled upon our project and reviewing the code submitted for pull requests.
            Eventually, I became one of the maintainers of the project and with a few close friends merged new changes to the game.

            I am knowledgeable about many of the principles and best practices of object oriented programming, and have been studying and practicing C# on my own for a new project the last year.
            I particularly enjoy strongly-statically typed languages due to their compile time changing and early and fast failure, but I am learning how to love weakly typed languages as well.
